### Frontend

1. **React:**  
   - For building a responsive, component-based user interface.
2. **React Router:**  
   - To manage client-side routing (login, news feed, educational modules, etc.).
3. **Redux or Context API:**  
   - For state management across the app.
4. **Tailwind CSS / Material-UI:**  
   - For rapid UI styling and design consistency.
5. **Axios / Fetch API:**  
   - For secure HTTP requests to backend APIs.

### Backend / API

1. **Node.js with Express:**  
   - For building RESTful microservices and the API Gateway.
2. **JWT & OAuth2 Libraries:**  
   - To handle secure authentication and authorization.
3. **Microservices Architecture:**  
   - Separate services for User Management, News Aggregation, AI functions, and Education.
4. **API Gateway / Central Router:**  
   - To route requests between services securely.
5. **Docker & Docker Compose:**  
   - For containerization and local/cloud deployment orchestration.

### Databases & Caching

1. **Primary Database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB):**  
   - PostgreSQL for relational data (user profiles, articles, educational content) or MongoDB for a more flexible, document-based model.
2. **Redis:**  
   - For caching frequently accessed data (e.g., summaries, bias ratings) and session management.
3. **Elasticsearch / OpenSearch:**  
   - For fast, bias-aware search functionality and analytics.

---

### AI & Machine Learning Components

1. **AI Models / Libraries:**  
   - TensorFlow.js, PyTorch, or Hugging Face Transformers (for advanced summarization and bias detection).
2. **Custom Node.js AI Service:**  
   - Wrap AI components as separate microservices to keep them isolated and scalable.
3. **Explainable AI (XAI) Libraries:**  
   - Tools like LIME or SHAP (for later explainability of bias detection, if needed).

---

### Infrastructure & Cloud Services

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS):**  
   - **ECS Fargate / Kubernetes:** Container orchestration for deploying microservices.
   - **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** For secure routing of requests.
   - **RDS (PostgreSQL) or DocumentDB (for MongoDB):** Managed database service.
   - **ElastiCache (Redis):** Managed caching.
   - **CloudFront & S3:** For serving static assets and content delivery.
   - **API Gateway & AWS WAF:** For managing API traffic and security.
2. **CI/CD Tools:**  
   - AWS CodePipeline/CodeBuild or GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

---

### Security

1. **HTTPS / TLS:**  
   - Enforce secure communication between all services.
2. **JWT / Multi-Factor Authentication:**  
   - For secure user authentication.
3. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
   - To restrict access to various parts of the system.
4. **Encryption:**  
   - Data encryption at rest (via AWS KMS) and in transit.
5. **Monitoring & Logging:**  
   - CloudWatch, AWS X-Ray, and centralized logging (e.g., using Winston) for auditing and incident response.

---

### Development & Testing Tools

1. **Version Control:**  
   - Git (with GitHub for repository hosting).
2. **IDE / Code Editors:**  
   - VS Code or similar, with GitHub Copilot for AI-assisted coding.
3. **Automated Testing:**  
   - Jest, Mocha, or similar frameworks for unit and integration tests.
4. **Code Linting & Formatting:**  
   - ESLint, Prettier to enforce code quality.
5. **Documentation:**  
   - README.md, inline documentation, and API documentation tools (Swagger/OpenAPI).
